# Number-Guessing-Game

When the user starts the game, the program will (secretly) generate a number and ask the user for a
guess. The user will enter the guess using a TextBox control and press a “Guess” Button. After this, the
program will increment the number of tries and display a message telling the user if the number is
lower, higher, or the secret value.

The user will continue entering numbers until finding the solution. When this happens, the program
will show a congratulation message and ask whether a new game should be started. If the user chooses
“Yes”, then the number of games will be incremented, the number of tries will be set to 0, and a new
secret number will be generated. If the user selects “No”, the program will exit.
